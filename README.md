# browser-node-module-boilerplate

> Boilerplate for creating a library for both the browser and node

This boilerplate is inspired from [sindresorhus/node-module-boilerplate](https://github.com/sindresorhus/node-module-boilerplate).
The scaffolding is similar, it adds support for shipping your code to the browser using Rollup as a bundler.
[Here is a great read about the choice of using rollup for libraries.](https://medium.com/webpack/webpack-and-rollup-the-same-but-different-a41ad427058c)
